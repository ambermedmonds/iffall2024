        <ol>
        <li>Hi, my name is Amber! I'm a junior majoring in Marketing with minors in Business Analytics and Design. </li>
        <li>I'm interested in product marketing/design and wanted to take this class to gain technical skills/knowledge so I can communicate more effectively with other designers and developers.</li>
        <li>I do not have any experience with HTML, CSS, or JavaScript, but I'm taking CSE 131: Intro to Computer Science this semester. </li>
        <li>I hope to learn how to build a website using code and create responsive designs that work seamlessly across different devices and screen sizes.</li>
        <li>One difference I expect to see is that designing for screens involves considering how users interact with elements such as buttons and links, whereas designing for paper tends to be more static.</li>
